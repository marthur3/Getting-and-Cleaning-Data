## Overview

This project is to demonstrate the ability to take in and clean messy data. The data itself comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset and is available for download at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Within the dataset there are two folders, test and train, which contain the raw data. Additionally there are four text files which provide more information about the raw data.
